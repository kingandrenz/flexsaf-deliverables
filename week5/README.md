# 📚 Student Task & Expense Manager

## 📌 Project Description

The Student Task & Expense Manager is a Python-based console application
designed to help students manage their academic assignments and daily
school-related expenses.

The program demonstrates the practical use of ordered data structures
such as lists and tuples, while applying indexing, slicing, list
methods, and list comprehensions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 Learning Objectives Covered

This project demonstrates:

-   Difference between Lists (mutable) and Tuples (immutable)
-   Creating, accessing, and updating elements using indexing
-   Extracting subsets of data using slicing
-   Applying common list methods:
    -   append()
    -   pop()
    -   sort()
-   Using tuples for fixed, structured data
-   Using list comprehensions for filtering data
-   Tuple unpacking
-   Menu-driven program structure

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🛠 Features

### ✅ To-Do List Manager

-   Add assignments
-   View all tasks
-   Mark tasks as completed
-   Remove tasks
-   Sort tasks alphabetically
-   Slice tasks (view first or last items)

### 💰 Expense Tracker

-   Add daily school expenses (item, category, amount)
-   View all expenses
-   Filter expenses by category
-   Filter expenses above a certain amount
-   Slice expense records

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧠 Data Structures Used

  Structure            Purpose
  -------------------- ------------------------------------
  List                 Stores tasks (mutable)
  Tuple                Stores expense records (immutable)
  List Comprehension   Filters expense data

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ▶️ How to Run

1.  Install Python (version 3.x).

2.  Save the program file (e.g., student_manager.py).

3.  Run the file using:

    python student_manager.py

4.  Use the menu to navigate through the system.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📖 Conclusion

This project provides a practical implementation of ordered data
structures in Python. It strengthens understanding of lists, tuples,
indexing, slicing, and common list operations in a real-world academic
context. This project is in done in fullfillment of flexsaf weekly task delivarables.
