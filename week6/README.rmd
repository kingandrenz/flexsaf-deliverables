# 📒 Student Contact Manager

## 📌 Project Description
The **Student Contact Manager** is a Python-based console application designed to manage student, parent, and teacher contact information. It demonstrates the use of **dictionaries** and **sets** for storing and validating data, while applying input validation and basic set operations.

---

## 🎯 Features
- **Add Contact**: Store details including ID, full name, email, phone, and role.  
- **Update Contact**: Modify existing contact details with validation.  
- **Delete Contact**: Remove a contact and update sets accordingly.  
- **Search Contact**: Find a contact by ID.  
- **List Contacts**: Display all stored contacts.  
- **Set Operations Demo**: Show union, intersection, and difference on email sets.

## 🧠 Data Structures Used
| Structure | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Dictionary (`contacts`) | Stores contact details keyed by unique ID |
| Set (`emails_set`, `phones_set`) | Ensures uniqueness of email and phone numbers |
| Regex | Validates email format |

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Install Python (version 3.x).  
2. Save the script as `student_contact_manager.py`.  
3. Run the program using:  

```bash
python3 student_contact_manager.py
```

## 📖 Conclusion
This project provides a practical implementation of dictionaries, sets, and regex validation in Python. It strengthens understanding of data storage, uniqueness enforcement, and menu-driven program design.
